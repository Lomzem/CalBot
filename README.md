## Usage

Let's say you had a discord message like this:
```markdown
ACM Club is meeting tomorrow from 4-6pm in OCNL 241!
```

There are two ways to convert this message into an iCal event:

1. Reply to the original announcement message with the `@CalBot` mention
2. Mention `@CalBot` in the original announcement message

An example of the first method:
```markdown
@Lomzem:
ACM Club is meeting tomorrow from 4-6pm in OCNL 241!

@Lomzem, replying to Lomzem:
@CalBot
```

An example of the second method:

```markdown
ACM Club is meeting tomorrow from 4-6pm in OCNL 241! @CalBot
```
